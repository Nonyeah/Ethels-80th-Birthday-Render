        Come help us celebrate the 80th birthday of our beloved mother,
        grandmother, sister and friend to many, Mrs Ethel Ulasi, who on 31st October
        2025 will have been alive to witness the earth rotate around the sun 80
        times, wow! We are truly grateful to God for blessing our dear mother with
        such a long and fruitful life and we pray our Good God will continue to
        satisfy her with his everlasting goodness.
